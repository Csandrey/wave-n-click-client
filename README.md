# Wave'n'Click (Android client) (Alpha)
Connects an Android device to a PC (with Windows installed) via Bluetooth.

This project aims to make it possible to use your Android device for
manipulating PC as if you were using a remote control.

Features supported at the moment:
* connecting to a PC (Windows) (need Wave'n'Click server, look at 'greencis/wave-n-click-server' repo)
* 11 buttons mapped to keys (you can change them on Keys mapping tab)
* mouse buttons and movement emulation
* scrolling mouse wheel
* typing text messages and sending them to the PC

Originally, Wave'n'Click had been written in Nov 2012 - Feb 2013. It was
presented at National Computer Science conference for secondary school
students in 2013 and won a second degree award.

The project is still in alpha stage of development, and many interesting
features are awaiting their implementation. Some bugs can occur, so use with
caution!

Wave'n'Click is built under Android Studio 2.1.2, minimal SDK version is 10
(I want Wave'n'Click to support my old Android phone :).
